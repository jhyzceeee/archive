                <h1>Hola! Welcome to my Website!</h1>
                <br>
                <h4>I am Jhyzcee Ron Noel R. Manalastas, 19 years of age and I live in SJDM, Bulacan. 
                    I was born on 13th of August year 2004 at Santa Mesa, Manila, Philippines. 
                    I took my Primary Education at P. Burgos Elementary School and graduated year 2016. 
                    Then I studied at Carlos L. Albert High School for my Junior High School and I graduated year 2020. 
                    Afterwards I took STEM strand at PHINMA Saint Jude College for my Senior High School. 
                    Now I'm currently taking Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Colegio de San Gabriel Arcangel. 
                    My parents are Jayson S. Manalastas and Christine Lvi B. Rivera. 
                    Both of them are Call Center Agent, my mother is working for Teleperformance while my father goes to Alorica. 
                    My hobbies are watching movies, specially sci-fi and mystery/thriller movies, playing online games, creating projects and I also play basketball. 
                    My childhood dream was to become a pilot but it's expensive that's why I end up being an IT student. 
                    My dream is to become a successful web developer someday. 
                    I also want to live near the seashore where it is cold andquiet. 
                    I would also like to travel to different places specillay Japan, Spain and Canada once I become financially stable.</h4>
